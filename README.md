# Masai Hoops
 
# Description
Fantasy Sports Manager is a full-stack application designed to assist fantasy sports enthusiasts in managing their teams more effectively. The backend is built using Flask (Python) while the frontend is developed using React.js, specifically utilizing React Three Fiber for advanced visualizations. The application leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained with Pandas, PyTorch, and NumPy to predict next year's player statistics and make strategic decisions such as which players to draft and identify performance trends. Additionally, the app includes a feature to solve linear equations using the grab bag problem solution to optimize weekly player pickups.

FYI: The name Masai comes from Masai Ujiri - the previous General Manager of the Toronto Raptors and personal hero of mine :)
